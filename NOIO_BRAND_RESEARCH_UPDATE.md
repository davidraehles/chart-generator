## Brand Website Analysis

NOIO's official website (https://www.noio.ch/) is hosted on Wix and contains limited publicly accessible color specifications in the HTML/CSS.

### Observed Brand Characteristics

From the NOIO website, the following design philosophy is evident:

1. **Aesthetic**: Minimalist, clean, professional
2. **Color Approach**: Neutral palette (whites, light grays)
3. **Typography**: Sans-serif, modern
4. **Layout**: Spacious, uncluttered
5. **Functionality**: Focus on clarity and usability

### Website Color Analysis

**Extracted Colors**:
- Primary Background: `rgb(255, 255, 255)` → `#FFFFFF` (Pure White)
- Secondary Background: `rgb(250, 250, 250)` → `#FAFAFA` (Very Light Gray)

**Design Philosophy Alignment**:
- The website uses a minimal, neutral color palette
- Heavy emphasis on whitespace and clarity
- Professional, modern aesthetic (aligns with minimalist German design principles)
- No bright or vibrant accent colors visible

## Recommendation: Maintain Current Color Palette

Based on the NOIO website analysis, the color palette already created is **highly aligned** with NOIO's design philosophy:

### Why Current Palette is Appropriate

1. **Minimalist Aesthetic** ✓
   - 10 core colors (not excessive)
   - Each color serves a functional purpose
   - No decorative colors
   - Aligns perfectly with NOIO's spacious, clean design

2. **Neutral Foundation** ✓
   - Navy primary (#2C3E50) is professional and trustworthy
   - Gray palette supports minimalist approach
   - White backgrounds match NOIO's usage
   - No saturated, vibrant colors (consistent with NOIO aesthetic)

3. **German Design Principles** ✓
   - Precision and clarity (high contrast ratios)
   - Efficiency (minimal color palette)
   - Professionalism (cool color temperature)
   - Functionality (colors only when meaningful)

4. **Accessibility** ✓
   - WCAG AA/AAA compliance exceeds standards
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Color-blind accessible
   - High contrast for readability

### Minor Adjustments Recommended

**Optional Future Refinement** (if NOIO provides formal brand guidelines):

If NOIO releases official brand color specifications, consider:

1. **Primary Brand Color Swap**
   - Current: `#2C3E50` (Deep Navy)
   - If NOIO has official primary color, swap this hex code
   - All other colors remain unchanged
   - No redesign required

2. **Secondary Accent Color** (if applicable)
   - Current: `#3498DB` (Bright Blue for gate points)
   - Could be adjusted to match official NOIO accent
   - Maintains accessibility standards

3. **Text Color** (if specified)
   - Current: `#1A1A1A` (Near Black)
   - Could adjust to official text color if provided
   - Must maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
